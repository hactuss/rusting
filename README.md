# RUSTING #
I'm currently learning how to programm in rust. I saw an old [No Boilerplate](https://youtube.com/@noboilerplate) video about it and had a Rust basics book lying around so I restarted learning rust. 
I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to do with this language but I'll make ure I use it for something good...
